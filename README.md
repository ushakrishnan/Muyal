**Muyal** is an enterprise-grade **intelligence hub** designed to unify your organization‚Äôs knowledge and AI capabilities into a **single source of truth** . Muyal is at its base [CEA](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azure-ai-foundry-blog/build-custom-engine-agents-in-ai-foundry-for-microsoft-365-copilot/4449623) (Microsoft Custom Engine Agent) and enables seamless integration across Microsoft 365, web platforms, and many other agent networks‚Äîdelivering **context-aware, intelligent responses** wherever your users work.

At its core, Muyal combines **templated knowledge sources** with **infinite extensibility** , ensuring that new domains can be added effortlessly and instantly leveraged across all connected channels. With **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** support and **Agent-to-Agent (A2A)** communication, Muyal doesn‚Äôt just serve as a knowledge engine‚Äîit becomes the **central nervous system** of your AI ecosystem, powering collaboration between tools, agents, and people.

## üê∞ Why "Muyal"? (The Rabbit Story)
"Muyal" means "Rabbit" in Tamil language - and there's a delightful reason behind this choice!

Just like rabbits, this AI agent is:

* ‚ö° Lightning Fast: Hops between AI providers faster than you can say "ChatGPT"
* üîÑ Multi-Platform: Jumps seamlessly from Teams to Web to Slack (like rabbits hopping between gardens)
* üå± Reproduces Quickly: One codebase, infinite platform adaptations (rabbits are known for... well, you know)
* üëÇ Always Listening: Those big ears aren't just for show - ready to respond on any platform
* üè† Adaptable: Comfortable in any environment - cloud, local, enterprise, or your garage server
* ü•ï Loves Good Food: Feeds on quality prompts and delivers even better responses

Plus, "Muyal" sounds way cooler than "GenericAIBot2024" and definitely more professional than "RabbitGPT" üòÑ

**Fun Fact:** In Tamil folklore, rabbits are considered clever problem-solvers who find creative solutions - exactly what this AI agent does when routing between 6 different AI providers! 

## Features

* **Single Source of Truth**: One backend intelligence system that serves Microsoft 365, MCP clients, web interfaces, and agent networks
* **Automatic Knowledge Enhancement**: Contextually aware responses without manual commands or data lookup - built on the [Microsoft CEA pattern](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azure-ai-foundry-blog/build-custom-engine-agents-in-ai-foundry-for-microsoft-365-copilot/4449623)
* **Templated Knowledge Sources**: Copy-paste template system for adding new knowledge domains - each new source instantly works across all platforms
* **MCP Integration**: Native Model Context Protocol server that exposes capabilities to Claude Desktop, VS Code, and any MCP client
* **Agent-to-Agent (A2A)**: Automatic agent discovery, registration, and inter-agent communication for building intelligent networks
* **Universal Platform Support**: Same intelligence engine powers Teams, Web, Slack, Discord, APIs, and custom integrations
* **Conversation Memory**: Persistent chat history with smart reset commands ("new conversation", "start fresh")
* **Multi-AI Provider Support**: Switch between Azure OpenAI, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI, and local models
* **Enterprise Observability**: W&B Weave integration for logging metrics, visualizing model performance, and monitoring experiments in real time

## Special Feature: Intelligence Extension through Templated Knowledge Source

**The Problem**: Adding new knowledge to AI systems traditionally requires:
* Platform-specific integrations for each channel (Teams, Web, Slack, etc.)
* Custom API endpoints and authentication per knowledge source
* Separate configuration for different AI providers
* Manual updates across multiple systems

**The Solution:** Muyal makes adding *Your Knowledge Domain* easy by using templated ways of adding knowledge sources.
1. Copy `template-knowledge.ts`
2. Define relevance keywords/patterns
3. Connect to your data source (API, database, files)
4. Add helpful suggestions
5. Drop it into knowledge sources folder
6. **Result**: Instantly works across all platforms and agent networks

## What is Muyal? (Simple Explanation)

**Muyal is like having a super-smart AI assistant that learns about anything you teach it, then works across every app you use.** You can teach it about weather, sports, homework, gaming stats, crypto prices - literally any topic. Just connect it to websites, spreadsheets, or documents, and it automatically knows when to use that information. The magic? Add a new "knowledge source" in 5 minutes using copy-and-paste, and instantly it becomes smarter about that topic everywhere - Teams, websites, other AI tools, all at once.

**Even cooler: Muyal creates AI teams that work together.** Think "group chat for AI assistants" - Muyal connects specialized AI helpers (weather bot, sports bot, homework helper) so they share information and coordinate. Build your own AI for anything you care about (tracking concerts, school projects), and it automatically joins the network, talking and collaborating with Muyal and all other AI helpers.
